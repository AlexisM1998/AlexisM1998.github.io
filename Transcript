Greetings ! I am Alexis Keyanna McBride and I am the daughter of Kizzy McBride and Robert Quinn. I was born June 26, 1998 and I am currently 17 years old, and is also  a recent graduate from Amanda Elzy High. While attending Amanda Elzy High from the years 2012-2013, I was a selective member of our school choir.  I participated in a spelling bee from 2011-2011. I have grown to try to expand my knowledge of the world around me. I have yet to engage in my future endeavors.
